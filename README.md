MERN Stack Job Portal is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) for job seekers and recruiters. The app allows job seekers to search and apply for job vacancies, while recruiters can post and manage job listings.

The repository includes a set of server-side and client-side code. The server-side code is built using Node.js and Express, and uses MongoDB as the database to store and retrieve job listings and job applications. The client-side code is built using React, and includes components for rendering the job portal interface and handling user interactions.

The app includes features like user authentication, job search and filtering, job application tracking, and job listing management. Users can create accounts, upload their resumes, and apply for job vacancies. Recruiters can post job listings, manage job applications, and communicate with job seekers. The app also includes email notifications and reminders to keep users informed about job vacancies and application statuses.

The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels. The repository includes detailed instructions for setting up and running the app locally.
